```sh
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem
```

```sh
avocado init </PATH/TO/PRIVATE_KEY.pem>
```

The CLI creates and reads this file in `$HOME/.avocado/` directory.

```sh
avocado get
```

### Decrypt

```sh
avocado decrypt <KEY> </PATH/TO/PRIVATE_KEY.pem>
```
decrypted value is written in to the clipboard.

### Delete
Remove element by key
```sh
avocado delete <KEY>
```
